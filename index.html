            <h2>States performance</h2>
            <p>Looking at the map its pretty evident that <span class="road_fatalities">Road fatalities</span> are more popular in NSW as compared to other states.This might be due to its huge population compared to other states. </p>

          <h2>Relation between fatalities and days</h1>
          <p><span class="road_fatalities">Fatalities</span> at different days and time of the days play a major role in road fatalities.Some of the major issues are due to reckless driving after work or long drives during the weekends.</p>

            <h2>Change in fatalities during weekdays and weekends</h2>
            <p>From the pie chart it is pretty evident most accidents occur <span style="font-weight: bold;"> the day on weekdays</span>.Apart from that we can also see that most of the accidents occur during the day. This might be due to people rushing to their respective workplaces.But looking at the heatmap we can see that for all the states most of the accidents occur during weekends i.e. Saturday and Sunday. Also Friday is one of the most popular days when fatilities occur more.This might be due to people rushing in to social clubs and other recreational places after a hefty week.According to "Conceptualizing and Measuring Weekend versus Weekday Alcohol Use: Item Response Theory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis" by NCBI Friday is the second most popular day with Saturday being first to drink which might be a cause of reckless driving.Thus resulting in fatalities.</p>

          <h2>Change in fatalities over Year</h2>
          <p>Here we can see a downward trend on fatalities which proves the effectiveness of changes applied by RTA.From the area chart above its pretty evident at speed limit of <span style="color:red;font-weight: bold;"> 100-120 </span>most of the fatalities occur.We can assume that these fatalities are in the highways.Accodrding to ubicar.com with higher speed the vehicle's tyre loses traction,causing the driver to lose  control of the car's steering.</p>

            <p>Accroding to this barchart though the number of accidents caused by both male and female has reduced a lot over the years.But male drivers has constantly caused more casualties compared to the female drivers.According to NRSPP National road safety programme this occurs due to the physiological, psychological, and behavioural differences</p>
